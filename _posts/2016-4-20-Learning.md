Coursera offers a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/" target="_blank">four-week course</a> on learning how to learn.

I’ve watched the videos straight through and realized that I haven’t really internalized the material, so I’ll do my best to jot down some salient thoughts — for your benefit and mine.

**Week 1** — Focused versus Diffuse thinking

You have two distinct modes of learning: focused and diffuse. This is a fact. When focused, your brain limits the number of thoughts going on in your head and you’re fully engaged in the moment. You’re limited in the number of connections you’re making at this moment. When relaxed, you’re in diffuse mode. Your thoughts are free to run around and you’re making stretched connections that you wouldn’t make while focused.

Main takeaway — know that studying too hard is a fool’s game. You need mental time off (even if it might seem like you’re going too easy) to maximize results.

**Week 2** — Chunks

Campbell’s Chunky soup is the best fuel for studying. No, that’s not an affiliate link, but if you do buy canned soup through Amazon, please let me know.

But seriously, you should know about chunking. If you’re a JavaScript fan, I see it as the mental equivalent of a closure. It’s like an enclosed space where a bunch of information and ideas connect. Once you hook onto the opening (an idea), the rest of the information is instantly recalled and you’re exposed to that world. You want more chunks, because these are how we store groups of information. The more chunks you have, the easier it is to build your knowledge, as they all link between each other. To get more, you use focused thinking to connect ideas and recall them later on to reinforce them in your memory. With enough time, they will become interweaved into a giant network and you’ll have a solid base of knowledge.

Einstellung — the idea that you’re going to use old neural pathways on figuring out solutions. Being too quick to use a hammer on everything, when there’s a better solution around the corner. Just be aware this is your natural state.

Law of serendipity — learning can suck, but if you keep showing up and following the gameplan, you’ll win the war.

Main takeaway — draw yourself to the ugly, painful activities. Testing yourself. Recalling information. Making mistakes. These are signs that you’re actually learning. If you’re having a good time highlighting up a storm, you’re due for pain later on.

**Week 3**—Procrastination and memory

Procrastination. Worst case scenario: you get fired from your job for not even trying to finish your projects. Second worst case scenario: you’re barely finishing them, and you’re burning out from last second cramming. Better scenario: you had a plan and you slowly chipped away at it. You finished with confidence and health.

How to end up in the better scenario:

And there are no shortcuts here:

And you’re going to hate these tips because you’ve seen them all the way since kindergarten:

- Planner journal. Write out your next day’s tasks the night before. Write out small tasks.
- Pomodoro — 25 mins work, 5 easy, 25 work, 5 easy, 25 work, 15 easy. rinse repeat.
- Do the hardest tasks first everyday. If it gets too hard to complete, swap out to easy within minutes. This switches from focused mode to diffuse. Switch back to a hard one. Like a chef preparing multiple things at once.

Memory. Long term memory is accessed through practice and repeating. That’s it. Procrastination will stop you from remembering anything. It’s unacceptable. Cramming will store information in your working memory — which only stores four items temporarily.

How to maximize the things you remember — use visual memory. Associate salient items with the topics. Group them together.

**Week 4** — Become a better learner

Brains grow more neurons if you exercise and learn.

Sometimes out of the blue your understanding of your knowledge will become a mess and jumbled. This may be your brain restructuring your learnings. Keep going.

Create visual metaphors and analogies. Use wordplay to your advantage. Place yourself in the place of the item and look around.

Experts often shut down their conscious thinking and let their subconscious dig through chunks for a solution to a complex problem.

You can change your brain neurons through thoughts.

The imposter syndrome — I get it all the time as an engineer. The fact that I consciously laughed at myself for writing the last sentence means I haven’t gotten over it. I’m not a CS graduate — engineers will call me out on it in one way or another for at least another decade.

Perseverance — keep going. this is a cliche. don’t gloss over it this time.

Testing — one hour testing is worth more than one hour reading. So, how do you know you’re prepared for a test? Follow a checklist. Dr. Richard Felder developed a checklist, originally for engineers(!), that can answer this:

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? No bullshitting here.
- Did you work with others on the problem and check the solution?
- Did you understand your work before handing it in?
- Did you ask questions and explanations on everything?

Panic during testing — raised cortisol levels. Not the end of the world. You have to convince yourself it’s excitement and not fear. Your performance will rise.
