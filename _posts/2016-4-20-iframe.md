title: Communicating with an iframe in 60 seconds
---

iframes. Cringe, I know. Generally we want to avoid using iframes, but if you’re in a pinch, they allow you some flexibility to get shit done.

Here’s one way to generate an iframe and insert it into your page:

  var testFrame = document.createElement('iframe');
  testFrame.style.display = 'block';
  testFrame.src = '/home';
  testFrame.id = 'foo'
  document.body.appendChild(testFrame);

Now, we’re assuming that the content in this iframe shares the same domain as parent page. If it’s a *cross-domain* page, you should *stop reading this post* and check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">docs on Window.postMessage</a>.

Now, let’s see how we can access the window and document in the iframe:

  document.getElementById('foo').onload = function() {
    var ifrm = document.getElementById('contentiFrame');
    var doc = ifrm.contentDocument? ifrm.contentDocument: ifrm.contentWindow.document;
    var win = ifrm.contentWindow;
  }

From here, you can manipulate the content within the iframe and even call functions in its window.
